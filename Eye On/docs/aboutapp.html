    DinDinSpins was developed to help you find places to eat. You can locate
    restaurants by spinning the wheel or by simply touching your country of
    interest. You can browse menus and check out discount coupons from the
    restaurants. The search filters will allow you to narrow restaurants down
    according to distance, price, and rating so you know you’ll get what you
    are looking for.
